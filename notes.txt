Snowflake interface (snowsight):
--------------------------------
> Worksheets: Write/run queries and code

Architecture:
-------------
> Data is compressed and stored in blobs (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Buckets)
> Virtual warehouses: A set of virtual compute engines query the data stored in blobs (also perform MPP wherein multiple servers come together to process big data)
> Cloud providers help to manage all of this: Managing infrastructure, access control, security, optimizer and metadata
> Virtual warehouse sizes (no. of servers): 
    > XS - 1, S - 2, M - 4, L - 8, XL - 16, 4XL - 128
    > Billed by minute (min. 1 minute)
    > Multi-clustering: When you a multiple queries to execute but 1 virtual warehouse is not sufficient, then you can use multi clustering which brings in multiple virtual warehouses together (like a cluster) so that queries dont get queued up

Scaling policy
--------------
> Scaling is required when the workload is high (more queries to be processed) 
> Policies
    > Standard:
        > This is the default scaling policy
        > Prevents/minimizes queuing by favoring starting additional clusters over conserving credits
        > Cluster starts immeditely when either a query is queued or the system detects that there are more queries than can be executed by the currently available clusters
        > Cluster shuts down after 2 to 3 consecutive successful checks (performed at 1 minute intervals) which determine whether the load on the least-loaded cluster could be redistributed to the other clusters 
    > Economy
        > Conserves credits by favoring keeping running clusters fully loaded rather than starting additional clusters
        > May result in queries being queued and taking longer to complete
        > Only if the system estimates there's enough query load to keep the cluster busy for at least 6 minutes
        > After 5 to 6 consecutive successful checks
